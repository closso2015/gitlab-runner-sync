# gitlab-runner-testing

This project is to do some basic concurrency testing with the gitlab-runners to explore what might be the optimal configuration to allow  projects to run concurrently without interfering with one another

I amd also using this repo for a simple gitlab-to-github POC and this change is being made to drive a change into the repo. Trying this one more time.
And again

one more time with gusto
